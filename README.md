## First Deal With API [application programming interface]
### Translator Web App
This is a simple web application that allows users to translate text from one language to another using the Google Translate API.
This project serves as my first exploration into using APIs, specifically the Google Translate API. It's a great learning experience for understanding how to integrate external APIs into web applications and provides a hands-on opportunity to work with asynchronous JavaScript (fetch API) for making API requests.
